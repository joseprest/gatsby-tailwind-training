Today we have pleasure announcing [Timeflow Academy](http://timeflow.academy), our platform for helping new and experienced Data Engineers level up their skills.  

Data Engineers are the people responsible for capturing, transforming and delivering data to data analysts, data scientists, and business stakeholders.

Though this a role growing in importance, there is a huge shortage of talent and experience in this field.  The mission behind Timeflow Academy therefore is to provide high quality training to help people transition from adjacent careers such as Software Engineers and Data Analysts into the field of Data Engineering.  

Our aim with the platform is to take a very hands on and practical approach to rapidly build skills in leading open source and cloud native technologies.  We will do this through hands on guided tutorials which quickly bring the topics to life without wading through reams of documentation. 

In addition, we aim to support our learners by welcoming them into our online community of Data Engineering professionals.

If this sounds interesting, please visit [Timeflow Academy](http://timeflow.academy) to give it a try today.
