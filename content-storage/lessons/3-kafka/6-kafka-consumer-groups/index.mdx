## Lesson Overview

In this lesson we will learn about Kafka Consumer Groups, including how to configure them and some of the relevant parameters.  

## About Consumer Groups

Kafka messages are produced by _producers_ and consumed by _consumers_.

In many instances, it makes sense to group our consumers into logical groupings.  For instance, we might have a group of consumers which are together responsible for consuming price updates.  

- If a member of group A consumes the message, other members may not 
- If a member of 

So consumer groups are a logical grouping.  

Another group of consumer 

## kafka-consumer-groups.sh 

The Kafka Consumer groups script allows us to view information about the consumer groups that are currently interacting with the broker instance.  

```
./bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

Outputs:

```
```

We can see here that there is one 

Let's use the kafka-console-consumer.sh script to subscribe but using a consumer group.  

```
./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --group-name pizzq_prorcessor
```

## Consumer Groups And Partitions

A consumer group is a collection of consumers organised into a logical group.  

Consumer groups have a tight relationship with the number of partitions from a correctness and performance perspective.  

Imagine we have a topic with 10 partitions:

- If we have 10 consumers in a group we are balanced, with each consumer servicing a different partition.  
- If we have more than 10 consumers in a group, some will sit idle.  
- If we have less than 10 consumers in a group, some consumers will process from more than one partition. 

We don't necessarily need to be "balanced".  This depends on the nature of the data and the requirements for failover and performance. 






## Consumer Groups

In many instances, it makes sense to group our consumers into logical groupings.  For instance, we might have a group of consumers which are together responsible for consuming order updates.  They need to co-ordinate in the folowing ways:

- Work should be evenly split across the group of consumers
- If a member of the group consumes the message, other members should not process the message
- If a member of the group crashes, other members of the group should step in and process the messages

Consumer groups allow us to achieve this behaviour.  


## Summary

In this lesson we took a deeper look into the consumer groups concept to see how they are used to improve reliability and throughput of your Kafka message processing.

In the next lesson we move on to look at the process for producing data and publishing it into Kafka topics.
