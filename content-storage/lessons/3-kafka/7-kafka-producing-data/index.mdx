## Lesson Overview

In this lesson we will learn about producting data to Kafka.

## Kafka Producers

Kafka Producers are processes which are responsible for sendnig data events to Kafka topics.  

A given producer connects to a broker and connects to one or more Kafka topics.  

They will then begin sending messages.


## kafka-console-producer script

The Kafka broker includes a script for producing messages from the console.  This is useful for debugging purposes. 

```
./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic new_pizza_orders
```

## Summary

In this lesson we took a deeper look into the process and considerations when publishing data into Kafka.

In the next lesson, we will look at performance testing Kafka by sending and consuming high volumes of data.
