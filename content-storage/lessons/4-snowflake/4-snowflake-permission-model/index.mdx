## Lesson Overview

In this lesson we will learn about the Snowflake permission model, including users and roles, and  how they are used to control access to various data within your databases.

## Role Based Access Control

As with many databases, Snowflake has a Role Based Access Control Model.  Permissions to read or write certain tables are granted to roles, and roles are granted to people.

Exanple roles might be:

- MANAGER
- SALESPERSON
- AGENT
- CASHIER
- ANALYST
- DIRECTOR

A particular set of permissions might be:

- MANAGER




## Creating Roles 

Roles are created using SQL 

```
create role storemanager;
create role storeemployee;
```

## Granting Permissions To Roles

We then grant permissions to the manager role.

```
alter role storemanager add 
alter role storemanager add 
```

## Granting Permissions To Users

```
alter user benjamin grant role manager
```


## Summary 

In this lesson we looked at the Snowflake permission model.
